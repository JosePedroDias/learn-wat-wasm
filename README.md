# Learn WAT WASM !

All WAT code so far is either copied from the book or heavily inspired by it.
Wasm-loading code was updated to latest node.js and browser APIs.

## Setting up your toolchain

### with wat-wasm

If you want to use the simpler to install `wat-wasm` tool, do

    npm install

    npx wat-wasm <wat file name>

### with wabt

If you prefer the `wabt` tools. Besides being faster, the debug-tools switch keeps the original symbol names, very helpful for debugging:

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt
    cd wabt
    git submodule update --init
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    cmake --build .

    wabt/build/wat2wasm --debug-names <wat file name>

edit the `build.mjs` script to target the toolset of choice (`COMMAND constant`)


## generating wasm from wat

Then to build all wat files do `./build.mjs`
Then to build 1 wat file do `./build.mjs <wat file name>`


## running the wasm file

To run an example on the browser, setup a local web server (`npm run host`) so it hosts this directory (index.html and all the wasm files)
and pass on the relevant parameters in the query string.

To run an example on node.js, use the `index.mjs`, passing the parameters as cli arguments.

The examples section below should make this clearer.


## examples

- **AddInt** (p.28, p.32) - sums two 32-bit numbers  
    http://localhost:8080/?AddInt.wasm,9,33  
    `node index.mjs AddInt.wasm 9 33`
- **HelloWorld** (p.44) - sets a string into a memory buffer and calls a JS function to print the string via console.log
    http://localhost:8080/?HelloWorld.wasm  
    `node index.mjs HelloWorld.wasm`
- **ForLoop** (original code) - does a loop between start and end, logging numbers in between
    http://localhost:8080/?ForLoop.wasm,3,9  
    `node index.mjs ForLoop.wasm 3 9`
- **Prime** (p. 84) - tests whether a number is prime. uses auxiliary functions
    http://localhost:8080/?Prime.wasm,9991249  
    `node index.mjs Prime.wasm 9991249`  
    I wrote the JS counterpart to the same algorithm and timed the two. On my M1 it performs roughly 70x faster with WASM.
    http://localhost:8080/?Prime.mjs,9991249  
    `node index.mjs Prime.mjs 9991249`
- **TableTest** (p. 108) - uses tables to assign and use function pointers. tests performance of calling wasm fns and js fns
    http://localhost:8080/?TableTest.wasm  
    `node index.mjs TableTest.wasm`
- **BigIntI64** (original code) - sums 2 i64 numbers in wasm. receives and returns BigInts
    http://localhost:8080/?BigIntI64.wasm,99999999999,44  
    `node index.mjs BigIntI64.wasm 99999999999 44`
- **Strings** (p. 138) - records strings in memory and their length is passed too. also exercises null terminated strings.
    http://localhost:8080/?Strings.wasm  
    `node index.mjs Strings.wasm`
- **NumberString** (p. 161) - converts unsigned i32 to a string
    http://localhost:8080/?NumberString.wasm,231  
    `node index.mjs NumberString.wasm 231`

## misc notes

### types

basic types: i32, i64, f32, f64

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/Understanding_the_text_format#types

and numeric instructions https://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/text/instructions.html#numeric-instructions


### type conversions

64-bit float to a 32-bit integer

`i32.trunc_s/f64`,
`i32.trunc_u/f64`


32-bit float to a 32-bit integer

`i32.trunc_s/f32`,  
`i32.trunc_u/f32`,  
`i32.reinterpret/f32`


64-bit integer to a 32-bit integer

`i32.wrap/i64`


64-bit float to a 64-bit integer

`i64.trunc_s/f64`,  
`i64.trunc_u/f64`,  
`i64.reinterpret/f64`

### memory allocation

memory allocated in pages. 1 page = 64KB

### strings

i64 needs string parsing on wasm side or
[bigint](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/BigInt)
and [experimental wasm bigint](https://sauleau.com/notes/wasm-bigint.html)

comes without any string abstraction

### s-expressions to unpacked WAT

```clojure
(i32.mul ;; executes 7th (last)
    (i32.add ;; executes 3rd
        (i32.const 3) ;; executes 1st
        (i32.const 2) ;; executes 2nd
    )
    (i32. sub ;; executes 6th
        (i32.const 9) ;; executes 4th
        (132.const 7) ;; executes 5th
    )
)
```

```clojure
i32.const 3 ;; Stack = [3]
i32.const 2 ;; Stack = [2, 3]
i32.add ;; 2 & 3 popped from stack, added sum of 5 pushed onto stack [5]

i32.const 9 ;; Stack = [9, 5]
i32.const 7 ;; Stack = [7, 9, 5]
i32.sub ;; 7 & 9 popped off stack. 9-7=2 pushed on stack [2, 5]

i32.mul ;; 2,5 popped off stack, 2Ã—5=10 is pushed on the stack [10]
```


### conditionals

There are no booleans in WASM. If expects an i32 any value other than 0 is considered true.

```clojure
;; This code is for demonstration and not part of a larger app
(if (local.get $bool_i32)
    (then
        <STUFF GOES HERE> ;; executes if i32 is not 0
    )
    (else
        <STUFF GOES HERE> ;; executes if i32 is 0
    )
)
```

```clojure
local.get $bool_i32
if
    <STUFF GOES HERE> ;; executes if i32 is not 0
else
    <STUFF GOES HERE> ;; executes if i32 is 0
end
```


### loops and blocks

```clojure
(block $block_name
    ...
    br $block_name
    ;; all subsequent lines of the block will be skipped
)

(block $block_name2
    ...
    local.get $should_i_branch
    br_if $block_name2
    ;; all subsequent lines of the block will be skipped if $should_i_branch is not 0
)
```

Loops work like blocks but branching takes you back to the beginning of the block, not the end.

```clojure
(loop $block_name
    ...
    br $block_name ;; infinite loop
)
```

If we want a loop not to be infinite, we have to place its branching logic inside a block living inside the loop.


There's also `br_table` but it has an ugly syntax and only pays off above ~~ 12 branches.
